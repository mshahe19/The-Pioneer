                                <p>After substandard performances from Daniel Ricciardo since he made the switch from Renault to replace Sainz, McLaren must consider new options as the possibility Ricciardo retires after this season begins to grow. Ricciardo, however, struggled with consistency aside from his first Formula One victory since May 2018 at the Italian Grand Prix. In the final seven races of the campaign, he only twice finished inside the top-10. Teammate Lando Norris has been on the front lines regularly in both qualifying and Sunday races, and the Brit dropped out of the top 10 only once in every race he finished. With his own approval, Ricardo took part in the 2022 campaign in hopes of better results, but McLaren took a step back this year. As the Aussie fails to impress with his 12th place ranking, the cards are in hand for a new driver to join the team.</p>
