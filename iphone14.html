                                <p>If the thought of upgrading your phone has every come to your mind, you have a lot of options to sift through. For example Apple’s flagship iPhone 13 series models are fantastic and the iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max are still holding up nicely, but some of you might want to wait for Apple’s 2022 iPhone, presumably called iPhone 14. Or even if you are not into the Apple ecosystem there are a lot of great choices.

Right now, the iPhone 13 series has some amazing upgrades on board, but we await much bigger changes coming this September with the new iPhone 14 series. That puts those of you in the market for a new phone in a tough position: Buy a new device right now or wait?</p>
                                <p>Even though Apple's iPhone announcements are still months away, many credible speculations have already surfaced.

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will reportedly come in five colours while the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max will come in four. Here’s what’s currently rumoured as the colours for the new phones:</p>
