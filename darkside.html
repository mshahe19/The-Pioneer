                                <h3 class="mb-3">The Dark Side of the Video Game Industry</h3>
                                <p>In 2022, the video game industry has become industrialised. Whilst some Indie games made by single, independent developers have taken off in recent years – namely “Stardew Valley”, created by Eric Barone, which generated well over 30 million dollars of revenue in its history – the market for video games remains widely monopolised by mammoth companies such as Electronic Arts (EA), Sony, Microsoft, and Epic Games, which release video games monthly, and often premium prices. EA alone has generated a total of 5.6 billion dollars in 2021, dwarfing the revenue of niche video games with ease. This overwhelming income, however, relies largely on the exploitation of a company’s employees and developers, who work on a suffocatingly tight schedule, during which overtime pay is rare, to agree with a studio’s overly ambitious expectations and release dates.</p>
                                <p>Video game companies have a brutal work culture, which expect employees to work up to 100 hours per week during their most busy periods: on average, that is over 14 hours daily. In a 2019 interview, an Epic Games employee exposed these inhumane working hours, reporting that “[They] hardly sleep… [They] have no energy to go out. Getting a weekend away from work is a major achievement”. A huge reason why such vicious working hours exist lies in the fundamental aspect of how Epic Games earns money from their video games. “Fortnite” Epic Games’ largest game, has made an astronomical amount of over $6 billion since its release in 2017. Despite this, “Fortnite” is free to play, and relies purely on micro transactions, which offer users in-game cosmetics such as ‘skins’ and comical dances. Therefore, in order for “Fortnite” to gain money, developers need to work endlessly in order to provide a constant influx of new content to retain gamers’ attention span, in the aim of users spending as much money as possible on these virtual items.</p>
                                <h4 class="mb-3"></h4>
                                <img class="img-fluid w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-2" src="img/.jpg">
                                <p>A further result of video game companies’ tight schedules is that, once these deadlines are met, many large companies are known to lay off a large proportion of their workforce. This is because, during in the creation of such games, in order to meet with impossible deadlines, it is necessary to hire more developers and workers to rush the game into completion. However, once deadlines are inevitably met, excess workers are no longer required. Without cause, major companies are know to fire large percentages of their workforce. This cheap pattern not only appears in a single company, but in almost all major video game manufacturers. A prime example of such behaviour took place in 2019, when Activision Blizzard fired 8% of its staff – 800 of its employs – without reason. This behaviour is repeatedly seen in major companies, where it is uncommon for Telltale Games, EA or even Microsoft to lay off hundreds of its employees at a time.</p>

                                <p>To conclude, the overwhelming demand for video games in this technologically consumed climate is provided almost solely via massive video game companies, and yet despite such mammoth income, they are unable to treat their own employees well, to the extent of forcing them to work 100 hour work weeks, at the risk of being fired should they fail, only for there to remain a large chance, that once they have met their deadline, they will be laid off none the less…</p>
