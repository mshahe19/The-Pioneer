                                <h3 class="mb-3">Samsung Galaxy S22 Review:</h3>
                                <p>The Galaxy S22's design is great for people who prefer smaller devices if you're willing to compromise on battery life. At a time when phones are getting bigger, Samsung is going smaller. The Galaxy S22, which starts at $800 and launches on Feb. 25, is the tiniest (and cheapest) phone in Samsung's new lineup. It has a 6.1-inch screen, making it slightly smaller than last year's Galaxy S21, and is otherwise identical to the Galaxy S22 Plus.</p>
                                <p>It's best to think of the Galaxy S22 as a moderate improvement over the Galaxy S21. It has a refreshed design and a new processor, but it's really the camera update that's the star of the show. The Galaxy S22 and S22 Plus both have a 50-megapixel main sensor that brings general improvements to color and clarity. All three of Samsung's new Galaxy phones are also better at taking photos in the dark.</p>
                                <h4 class="mb-3"></h4>
                                <img class="img-fluid w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-2" src="img/.jpg">
                                <p>These are welcome improvements that have made the Galaxy S22 enjoyable to use for the most part. But they also aren't game-changing updates that bring substantially new features to the Galaxy S22. They just make Samsung's phones a bit better at most of the things they were able to do before, particularly photography.</p>
