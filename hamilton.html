                                <h3 class="mb-3">Hamilton review</h3>
                                <p>Hamilton was hailed as revolutionary theatre in 2015, with its rapping 18th-century statesmen, its funky hip-hop and a cast predominantly comprising actors of colour. It went on to conquer Broadway and West End audiences. How does that original Broadway staging fare on the flat screen, streamed by Disney+ in the midst of lockdown? </p>
                                <p>“It spoke to the moment then, and it speaks to us now,” say director Thomas Kail and Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator and star, in their short, socially distanced preamble to this highly anticipated film of the show. “We are all thinking about what it means to be American,” they add. Even if these words are not in direct reference to the America of the past few weeks, with its upsurge of anti-racist protest, their story of the Caribbean-born immigrant hero and founding father of the US, Alexander Hamilton, speaks to us all that which remains neglected in America’s history. </p>
                                <h4 class="mb-3"></h4>
                                <img class="img-fluid w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-2" src="img/.jpg">
                                <p>Miranda’s lead performance brims with understated brilliance. Every actor alongside him performs with just as much conviction though: Phillipa Soo is a demure Eliza Hamilton until she breaks out, gloriously, into beat-boxing and Daveed Diggs is a funny Thomas Jefferson with his cool raps and his attitude.
