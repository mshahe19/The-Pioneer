                                <p>European markets slumped in a sea of red on Wednesday after a fake US inflation report that circulated on Tuesday hit Wall Street stocks.

In London, the FTSE 100 tumbled 0.8% after the opening bell, the CAC was 0.5% lower in Paris and the DAX fell 1.1% in Frankfurt.

It comes after the UK economy grew by more than expected in May, with a bounce back across all sectors despite the cost of living crisis.

Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 0.5% from April when output declined 0.3%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Economists polled by Reuters had predicted the economy to stagnate.</p>
                                <p>The ONS said health was the main contributor, with services output up 0.4% as human health and social work activities grew by 2.1%.

A slight uptick had been anticipated, but at 0.5% the pace of growth has caught many by surprise.

These figures represent just one month – albeit a crucial one because it means the quarter as a whole doesn’t meet the criteria for negative growth – but one month can never tell the whole story.
