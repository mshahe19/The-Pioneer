                                <p>The latest look at Pokemon Scarlet and Violet has made us all the more excited to jump right into the upcoming open-world adventure. With a fresh trailer confirming some exciting new features and details about each version, we also got to see more of the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet starters. With the introduction of new Legendaries, the much-admired pig critter Lechonk, new professors, and confirmation that the latest entry will support four-player multiplayer, there are plenty of reasons to get hyped about new Pokemon games.  
We've even finally gotten an official November release date for what has easily become one of the most anticipated upcoming Switch games. If you're looking forward to what looks set to be an exciting evolution for the series, read on below to find out everything we know so far about Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.</p>
                                <p>We were surprised in more ways than one when the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet reveal trailer landed. Not only do we get to go on a new adventure in the world of Pokemon, but we won't even have to wait that long to experience it. Despite Legends: Arceus already launching this year, Nintendo has now confirmed that Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are set to release on November 18, 2022.
Pokemon Sword and Shield gave us the chance to run around certain wild areas, which was then expanded upon in Pokemon Legends: Arceus. The latter release had several big open areas across a world map to explore, but it still wasn't truly open-world. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet looks set to take this an evolutionary step further with an open world that features towns that "blend seamlessly into the wilderness with no borders". We'll once again be able to see Pokemon out in the wild, with the freedom to explore this new region in the skies, seas, streets, and forests. The trailer showed off various locales</p>
