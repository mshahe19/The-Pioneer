                                <h3 class="mb-3">Covid-19 still alive and running in Britain? </h3>
                                <p>More than 200,000 people have died of Coronavirus so far in its current run of more than 2 years. (According to the ONS- the Office of National Statistics). The actual death toll of 200,000 was reached on June 25th of this year. This astounding number is partly due the recent spike of coronavirus cases, mainly due to the new covid variant- Omicron BA.2. Coming behind that was the Alpha variant that occurred during January of this year. 

 

Moreover, covid testing and general regulations have been heavily eased compared to the earlier years of 2021 and 2022. For example, there have been much less enforcement in regular testing, and even if one does contract the virus, there is only a 3-day isolation period.  </p>
                                <p>Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign, called the 200,000 deaths “a tragedy” and “yet another damning milestone of the Government’s handling of the pandemic”. 

 

Specific statics from sources say that in 2020, A total of 94,998 deaths involving Covid-19 took place in the UK in 2020, compared with 82,200 in 2021 and 23,049 so far in 2022. </p>
