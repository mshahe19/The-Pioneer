                                <h3 class="mb-3">Is Building a Custom Computer in 2022 Really Worth it?</h3>
                                <p>Whilst in the early 2000s, the niche idea of PC building seemed like an alien concept to most – exclusive to professionals, in recent years computer building has become easier than ever, with adults and children alike engaging in this thrilling activity. Despite such overwhelming popularity, PC building remains an expensive hobby, for people with both time and money in their hands, with the majority of computer parts in limited supply, following the Covid-19 pandemic, leaving many new gamers questioning whether it is in fact worth squandering money and energy into such a lavish project, or better to simply settle for a prebuilt, ‘more reliable’ computer.</p>
                                <p>A prominent argument for the custom building of a computer, is that in purchasing each individual component separately and constructing the computer independently, one would avoid the cost that prebuilt computer companies charge for the construction of the computer. In theory, this is a legitimate argument, however in practice this often is not the case. Individual computer components are nevertheless quite costly. In today’s market, it is not rare to find components that exceed hundreds of pounds. Most pricey of these being graphics cards, which – when in short supply – can be sold by scalpers for thousands. On the other hand, the companies that prebuild computers acquire their components in bulk, directly from the manufacturer. In this way, these companies are able to avoid any over extortionate prices, inevitably reducing the price of the entire computer.</p>

                                <p>Despite prebuilt computer companies claiming a sizable fee for the construction of their PCs – which many gamers avoid through building their own computer, when this fee is compared to the often larger cost of acquiring individual PC parts, it is often cheaper, and more beneficial to invest into a prebuilt computer.</p>
