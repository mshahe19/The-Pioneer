                                <p>Following a convincing 3-1 victory over Masters Reykjavik 2022 victor OpTic Gaming in the VCT (Valorant Champions Tour) NA Stage 2 Challengers championship match, XSET has been crowned the new North American Stage 2: Valorant Champions Tour champions.

Both teams had just locked their spots in the Masters Copenhagen, but the best-of-five series would determine the teams' seeding for the July tournament.

With their victory, Matthew "Cryocells" Panganiban and his group secure the top seed in Copenhagen and a place at Valorant Champions in September. If Copenhagen follows Reykjavik's format, XSET will likely begin their Masters campaign in the playoffs while OpTic would have to compete in the group stage.

OpTic were the first team to clinch a spot in Copenhagen, defeating XSET 3-1 during their first meeting in the upper bracket final.

The tables turned in the grand finale, however, with XSET flipping the score around. While OpTic narrowly won their map pick of Fracture 14-12, the next three maps were all XSET’s game.</p>
                                <p>With the help of a remarkable performance from 17-year-old prodigy Zachary "zekken" Patrone, who played four different agents across four maps, the always fourth-placed squad had finally broken the curse. Zekken demonstrated why he is regarded as one of the team's stars, along with Cryocells, by finishing the series with a favourable 40 K/D differential and 18 first kills.</p>
                                <h4 class="mb-3"></h4>
                                <img class="img-fluid w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-2" src="img/.jpg">
                                <p>That said, it’s worth pointing out that several OpTic players were still struggling with the symptoms of COVID-19, and Pujan“FNS” Mehta and Austin “crashies” Roberts had tested positive for coronavirus.

XSET went on to pick Haven against OpTic, a map that OpTic had originally picked in their previous matchup. The map was aone-sided 13-3 victory in XSET’s favour, and the team carried their momentum into Bind.

Zekken showed himself to be one of the most versatile duelists in North America, pivoting from Neon to Jett and then Raze.

On the fourth and final map, Ascent, he then switched to Sova, while Cryocells returned to his signature Jett. Ascent turned out to be a much closer affair, with OpTic at first running ahead to a 9-3 defending half. They then picked up two more rounds in the second half, putting them ahead 11-3.

However, XSET would not let the series go to a fifth map. They began to chip away at OpTic’s lead, stringing together 10 rounds to complete the comeback and win 13-11.

OpTic repeated their Stage 1 performance in second position. Additionally, XSET is participating in their first international LAN in Copenhagen, just like The Guard did in Reykjavik.

When Stage 2 Masters begins on July 10, the squad will be aiming to finally establish themselves on the international stage.</p>
