                                <p>For the first time since the global pandemic in 2020, stocks have rallied in Taiwan after government authorities pledged to prop up domestic shares.

The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Index closed 2.7% higher on Wednesday, the biggest jump in nearly four months. The National Financial Stabilization Fund received authorization to support local equities after its committee concluded an extraordinary meeting a day earlier, according to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
                                <p>The intervention underscores the many challenges confronting Taiwan’s tech-reliant market, which has been buffeted by a weaker outlook for the sector and rising fears of a US recession. Shares fell into a bear market earlier this month as foreign selling exerted pressure. Global funds have withdrawn nearly $35 billion since the start of the year.

“The news that the stabilization fund will support the market should be able to stop stocks from declining further and boost investor confidence in the short-term,” said Harris Liao, chief investment officer at Concord Securities Co. “But whether Taiwan stocks can bottom out depends on the stabilization of US 10-year government bond, US inflation number and US tech stocks. There are still many uncertainties.”</p>

                                <p>All but one of the 28 sub-gauges of the benchmark stock index rose Wednesday. Chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which accounts for more than a quarter of the index’s weighting, jumped 4.7%. The firm is expected to report results on Thursday.
