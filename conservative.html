                                <p>With the number of candidates for the next Prime Minister starting to thin, this article will compare Rishi Sunak, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, to Penny Mordaunt, former Minister of State for Trade Policy.

Penny Mordaunt has shown herself to be an avid supporter of Brexit and to achieving net zero, however Ms. Mordaunt supported repealing the Gender Recognition Act and outlawing conversion therapy for all LGBTQ+ people while she was minister of women and equalities. Furthermore, she has rejected the term "woke" while running for office and says she has "addressed the trans dogma with real and genuine concern." Last week, she admitted to LBC that she has never personally backed changes to the legislation regarding gender recognition. She is also the only candidate thus far who has pledged to undo the Treasury's "stealth tax" of freezing income tax thresholds is Ms. Mordaunt. While cutting taxes, she has promised to "pioneer sound money and implement a critical fiscal guideline to ensure that debt as a percentage of GDP declines over time. “However, she has stated that focusing just on tax increases or decreases is a massive oversimplification of our economic difficulties.</p>
                                <p>Rishi Sunak claims that he is the best candidate to turn around the failing economy that he has been in charge of for the past 2.5 years, and that he can do this without the tax cuts the government demand, which he has ridiculed as "fairytale" politics. If he wins, he will also eventually need to persuade the electorate that his status as one of the wealthiest MPs in Westminster—thanks to his marriage to Akshata Murthy, the daughter of an Indian billionaire—need not stand in the way of his ability to comprehend the realities of poverty in Britain today and provide the support they require in the face of rising costs and prices, as well as rapidly declining living standards as inflation bites.</p>
