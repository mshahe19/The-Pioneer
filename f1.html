                                <h3 class="mb-3">Austrian Grand Prix</h3>
                                <p>Charles Leclerc managed to narrowly edge out Max Verstappen to win this years Austrian Grand Prix as Lewis Hamilton also found a spot on the podium. By taking the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday, Leclerc was able to leapfrog Max Verstappen's in the Drivers' Championship standings. Ferrari played their cards right in terms of strategy earning good points for the team at the Red Bull Ring, and the Italian team’s driver, seemed to simply outclass the Dutchman for the entirety of the race.</p>
                                <p>Unfortunately for Ferrari, they were not able to secure the top two finish they wanted as Sainz was unable to finish the race due to an engine failure in the closing stages of the race as he battled with Verstappen before his car went up in flames in another unfortunate occurrence for the Spaniard. Leclerc almost threw his lead away at the end with his own issues in the form of his throttle pedal but luckily for Ferrari, he hung on to claim an incredibly impressive victory. Fan favourite Lewis Hamilton did well for himself similarly, managing to secure a podium finish from far back in his 8th position start.</p>
                                <h4 class="mb-3">Michael Masi leaves the FIA!</h4>
                                <img class="img-fluid w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-2" src="img/.jpg">
                                <p>Following a great controversy around last year’s title decider in Abu Dhabi, Masi was forced out from his position as the F1 race director. The improper deployment of the Safety Car period, which allowed Max Verstappen to defeat Lewis Hamilton, was ultimately determined to be the result of "human error" by the regulatory body of Formula One (FIA). He was then replaced by rotating colleagues Eduardo Freitas and Niells Wittich for 2022, being promised a new role on the board instead. Five months later, however, they have now officially announced that Masi has decided to leave the FIA and migrate to Australia to be closer to his family and take on new challenges. After a three-year spell with the organisation, "The FIA thanks him for his commitment and wishes him the best for the future." Unfortunately for him, his mistake was not taken lightly, and at the end of the day, this was surely the turning point in his decision to leave.</p>
