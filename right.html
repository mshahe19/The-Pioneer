                                <h3 class="mb-3">Priti Patel: Right or Racist? </h3>
                                <p>Priti Patel recently announced that she is planning to deport hundreds of refugees to Rwanda, a small country in the continent of Africa. She calls this her ‘Rwandan Relocation Plan’ and decides to plough through with such a decision despite fierce opposition. One example being the Archbishop of Canterbury, who criticized the policy as ‘immoral’ and even Prince Charles said that the policy was ‘appalling’. Priti Patel also announces that she won’t actually be running for Tory leader, despite the recent announcement of the resignation of PM Boris Johnson, instead increasing her focus of boosting police force numbers and generally “controlling our borders”.  </p>
                                <p>“As Home Secretary I have always put the security and safety of our country and the national interest first and my focus is to continue working to get more police on our streets, support our amazing security services to keep our country safe and control our borders”- Home Secretary Priti Patel. </p>
                                <h4 class="mb-3"></h4>

                                <p>According to her, the idea to transfer them to the nation of east Africa to request asylum would send a "clear signal" that they would not have the right to remain in the UK. 

  

The Home Office announced that it will soon start notifying people that they would be moving to Rwanda, but it recognised that there would be some delays because of legal issues. Lawyers, according to Ms. Patel, would erect "hurdles and roadblocks" to prevent it. </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-3"></h5>

                                <p>She continued by saying that the administration was determined to be putting the plan into action and that it will expunge everyone who entered the country "illegally" using "every tool and every piece of legislation at our disposal."  

Under the scheme, people who are seeking asylum after being deemed to have entered the UK unlawfully will be flown to the African country, where their application will be processed. If successful, they would then have the choice of staying in the African nation permanently. When asked if she was certain the strategy would succeed and when the project would start, Ms. Patel responded, "I've stated from day one, even when I signed the agreement and announced the partnership, that this will take time and it will take time for a variety of reasons. We encounter a number of difficulties and obstructions, mostly from specialised law firms that seek to prevent the expulsion of those who are not authorised to be in the nation.” 

  

The government now has "more authorities and greater methods" to expel those who do not have a valid reason to remain in the UK, Ms. Patel continued. </p>
