                                <p>Wimbledon, Wimbledon, Wimbledon. How it always entertains us, with its tricks and turns and this year is no different. Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from the competition, ahead of his semi-final match against Nick Kyrgios, due to a severe abdominal injury. The Spaniard received a form of treatment during his quarter-final match, on the 6th July, against Taylor Fritz where he miraculously defied his pain to win in five sets. Nadal upon announcing his withdrawal stated that, "I have tried a lot of times in my career to keep going but it’s obvious the injury will get worse”. The 36-year-old confirmed to the public that he had a tear in his abdominal muscle, which prevents him from being able to play competitively for at least 2 matches.</p>
                                <p> The 22-time Grand Slam champion had only been practicing at Wimbledon, away from the medias eye, on the morning on the 7th, before he ultimately called for a news conference. Nadal’s final message to reporters was, "The most important thing is happiness more than any titles. I can’t risk that match and stay 2 or 3 months out of the competition.” Kyrgios, who will now play Novak Djokovic or Cameron Norrie in Sunday’s final, added a heartfelt statement on social media, affirming his respect, declaring: “We all hope to see a healthy you soon.” We all wish Nadal the best in his recovery and look forward to seeing him return to the court. </p>
