                                <h3 class="mb-3">Chess’ Comeback</h3>
                                <p>Chess has recently had an explosion of popularity. This classic board game has had a resurgence of popularity, mainly because of 3 major factors: the explosion of chess twitch streamers, the quarantine, and the website chess.com.

The quarantine

The quarantine can be seen as a catalyst for the boom of players on chess sites and an increased interest in chess related content.

The quarantine has made chess content surge in popularity. As the quarantine made many bored out of their mind people moping in their house. People had nothing to do other than consume content, so then many developed new interests to keep them occupied like chess.

As normal video games became repetitive and boring people needed a new way to entertain themselves. Chess was the perfect alternative to the now boring unstimulating videogames. Chess entertained people’s minds and let people fight against their friends in a battle of wits.

There was a negative stigma surrounding chess before, as many thought chess was boring, uninteresting and for “nerds” but now chess has a more respectable position in online culture. The Pandemic is an unignorable cause for the bubbling and vibrant chess community in many parts of the internet</p>
                                <p>Chess.com

This website is one of the sole factors of the sudden spike of interest in chess. The website had 30 million members pre-pandemic in March 2020. Nearly doubling to 57 million within the span of a single year. Now, the number is more than 77 million.

The website has introduced a more convenient way to play chess opposed to traditional with a board which can put people of from playing in the first place. The website lets people play online with people from different continents. This gives people a chance to test out the game without investing in a chess board to see if they enjoy the sport.

The website offers lessons, coaching, tournaments and chess puzzles in addition to many different variants of the game. There are also ways to play with random people around your skill level when you don’t have someone to play with. Through the Elo rating system using games won and games lost assigning a number to each player matching people with players with players with a similar rating. Further more, there are bots that you can play against that are all around your specific skill level.</p>
                                <h4 class="mb-3"></h4>

                                <p>s Hikaru Nakamura, an American chess twitch streamer, born December 9th 1987 in Hirakata, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. He developed an interest in chess and at the time he was the youngest Grand master (the highest title a chess player can achieve) in 2003, only to be beaten by Abhimanyu Mishra.

Through his collaborations with famous Twitch streamers (xqc, Ludwig and more) chess was introduced to a newer audience. Ultimately, reviving the sport, that was deemed boring and not interesting. Many people loved the new content, resulting in the development of a tournament called “Pogchamps”, which happened 4 times. These tournaments shattered viewership records with above 500 million minutes watched.

This boom in viewership started the creation of an environment fostering a wholesome chess scene in twitch with streamers such as: Gotham chess, the Botez sisters and even the chess world champion Magnus Carlsen.</p>
                                <h5 class="mb-3"></h5>

                                <p>The future of chess

Once life returned to normal with quarantine being lifted, chess had a noticeable drop in viewership. Raising many questions, what will happen now? could this have been just a trend and now chess will fall into obscurity?

I think it’s safe to say no, this popularity boom has secured chess a spot in newer generations hearts and has touched people who would have never played chess otherwise. This game will continue as a timeless sport that will be played for thousands of years more.</p>
