                                <h3 class="mb-3">Travel Losses and how you can help</h3>
                                <p>After weeks of travel difficulties, airline passengers are hundreds of pounds in debt. Some passengers with cancelled or diverted flights organised their own alternate transportation. Airlines should weigh in to reimburse the charges, but some people who had to pay for their own transportation home are apparently not getting their money back.

If a flight is cancelled, you have the option of being reimbursed or diverted. The airline is expected to transport you to your destination as soon as possible, even if it means transferring you to another carrier. If the flight is cancelled or delayed by more than three hours within 14 days of the departure date, you are also entitled to a specific sum of compensation starting at £220 per person, depending on how many days' notice you were given and how distant the destination is. If the cancellation was due to an "exceptional situation," there is an exemption.</p>
                                <p>The definition of what is and isn't extraordinary is imprecise, and airlines try to exploit it as a catch-all to avoid compensation, but consecutive court judgments have narrowed the list to things like unusual weather, manufacturing problems, and non-airline employee industrial action. Staff illness or shortages are not considered. If you are delayed for more than two hours on a short-haul trip or four hours on a long-haul journey, the airline is required to supply you with meals, phone calls, and, if you are detained overnight, hotel charges. A potentially costly grey area is arriving at your location late at night after public transportation has closed.Costs incurred to travel to where you need to go are considered "consequential loss," and airlines are not required to compensate them.</p>
                                <h4 class="mb-3"></h4>
                                <img class="img-fluid w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-2" src="img/.jpg">
                                <p>You can file an appeal with an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) programme after receiving the rejection letter or after eight weeks without receiving a response. Different airlines are members of several schemes; the complaints page on the airline's website should refer you to the appropriate one, and the CAA maintains a list. Membership in airlines is voluntary, and one of them, CEDR, which British Airways customers must use, imposes a £25 fee if a claim is denied. When an ADR scheme ordered Ryanair to pay £2.6 million to passengers delayed by strikes in 2018, the airline resigned from the scheme to avoid paying. Passengers on Ryanair must now file a complaint with the CAA.

Additionally, to prevent last-minute travel chaos, the UK government has instructed airlines to cancel flights now rather than later. The surge in demand follows weeks of mayhem at European airports, with thousands of holidaymakers suffering delays, lines, and cancellations.

Many airlines have already slashed summer flight schedules to deal with understaffing. British Airways was recently forced to cancel 8,000 flights in its March-October schedule, while EasyJet has cut roughly 40 flights per day for the rest of the month.

The government’s instruction could mean further cancellations for Britons travelling in July, August, and September. EasyJet announced yesterday that all flights from the UK to Hurghada, Egypt, had been cancelled until the end of July. The airline issued an apology to customers, blaming the decision on "industry-wide operating issues. “Italy’s aviation strikes led Ryanair and Jet2 to cancel flights to the country last week. The turmoil reached a climax near the end of the half-term break.

Nearly 200 flights into UK airports were cancelled during the bank holiday weekend, including EasyJet, British Airways, and Wizz Air, leaving holidaymakers stranded abroad. Hundreds of short-haul flights have also been cancelled by British Airways, who stressed that passengers were informed in advance as part of a timetable adjustment that would last until October.

Brexit, according to London Mayor Sadiq Khan, is to blame for the chaos at Britain's airports. He urged the government to ease immigration restrictions so that EU airport and airline workers could return to the UK and avoid a summer of "misery."

However, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps dismissed the claims, claiming that allowing "cheap" foreign workers in was not the solution to alleviating pressure on the aviation sector. Instead, he blamed industry executives for "cutting too far" during the pandemic and failing to anticipate that so many people would return to international travel once restrictions were lifted. Shapps stated that he will "do absolutely everything possible" to ensure that people can travel abroad this summer without encountering any problems at airports. He also stated that he had already responded to industry requests to expedite security checks for new employees and to allow those in non-security jobs to begin training immediately.</p>
