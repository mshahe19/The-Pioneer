                                <p>The events that is the war between Ukraine and Russia are known worldwide and most of the world support the refugees that flee from their home country. Despite the Ukranian population having such a load to bear, they have shown great perseverance as they fight to keep their home nation striving. Life in Ukraine isn’t the same as Putin’s devious plans to annex the country result in the countless loss of lives.  

 

As a response from Britain, Boris Johnson is expected to announce the uplift in the British Army to respond to the threat that is Vladimir Putin. It’s often referred to as their “1937 moment” (in reference to the upcoming years to World War II), but nevertheless, Britain is mobilising its army not to provoke war, but just to prevent war as the current situation in Ukraine is ‘unprecedented’ (General Sanders from the British army).  </p>
                                <p>Because of such a threat, Boris Johnson carves out a significant portion of money from his own defence secretary on the U. K’s ‘smoke and mirrors budget’. General Sanders has plans to further reduce the size of the British army from a target figure of 82,000 to 75,000, saying that Britain will have to persevere. 

 

The war between Ukraine and Russia all began in the earlier months of 2022, specifically around February. Russian PM Vladimir Putin’s gave his casus belli because they were provoked by Ukraine threatening to join NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). This means that Ukraine can perform military practices in the country whilst making it extremely easy for them to invade Russia. </p>
