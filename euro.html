                                <p>Eurovision 2022 raised much talent, as well as spirits, especially despite the tough times many are going through these past couple of years. Hosted by the previous winners, Italy, Eurovision was held in The Pala Alpitour in Turin which managed to cost them around €6.2 Million to prepare.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <h4 class="mb-3">The Acts</h4>
                                <img class="img-fluid w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-2" src="img/.jpg">
                                <p>Opening the show was Czech Republic with the song ‘Lights Off’ sung by We are Domi which ended up putting them only in 22nd place with a puny 38 points. But how did the ‘big 5’ compare to all the other acts? The big 5 are the patrons for the event and get automatic entrance into the grand finale of 25; they are UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. France was the first of the big 5 to perform and some might say it was quite underwhelming. Despite all the special effects to dampen the atrocity of the song, ‘Fulenn’, sang by Alvan and Ahez, the public decided that it was only worth 17 points and 24th place. Spain brought Chanel who sung ‘Slomo’ which blew the audience and the jury away and earned a spot on the podium at 3rd place with 459 collective points. Italy took a different approach than last year and rather than going full metalhead, they had Mahmood and Blanco performing ‘Brividi’, a somber song which scored them 268 points and 6th place. Germany put forward a solo guitarist, Malik Harris, singing ‘Rockstars’ which surprisingly only scored Germany 6 points and put them last out of the 25 acts. The final of the big 5, Sam Ryder (for the UK), sung his new hit ‘SPACE MAN’. His amazing talent and unbelievable vocals dazzled the audience and he rocketed into 2nd place with a huge 466 points; just getting the edge over Spain. Bear in mind, this year was the first time in 7 years the UK had received a single point, let alone finish in second place. A moment to certainly savor and cherish for the UK.</p>

                                <p>The winner

After 25 special performances, only one could win, and that was Ukraine. By. A. Landslide. They had the Kalush Orchestra singing ‘Stefania’ for which they were commended a whopping 631 points and the opportunity to host Eurovision 2023 in Ukraine next year. However, that is still an uncertainty due to the situation Ukraine is in currently and they are speculations that the 2nd place would host instead (which would be the UK), if Ukraine’s problems aren't resolved by then.

Honorable mention

Despite only finishing 10th in the competition, I believe (and many agree) with me that Norway's performance from Subwoolfer of “give that wolf a banana”. The hit was very popular amongst the public but unfortunately did not hit as well with the country's jury and their final score total

was 182 points. Findlay Reid, an avid watcher of the Eurovision Song Contest, shared “Norway have had many great Eurovision songs over the last couple of years, such as Spirit in the Sky and Fallen Angel, but their new release for 2022 is pure brilliance. Everything from costumes to rhythm could not be better, and I cannot see, once again, why Norway have not won the competition.”</p>
