                                <p>Kiev has been striking back in the Southern Horizon region now occupied by Russia

Ukraine says that its forces destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and killed more than 50 soldiers however, the Russian state media gave a different account claiming at least seven people were killed Ukraine is hailing it as a victory as it tries to drive back Russian force the Ukrainian government says this is the moment its rockets hit a Russian military depot in Nova, Kakova in Ukraine's south Russian-backed officials say U.S supplied weapons were involved in the strikes Ukraine's president says his forces are aiming to reclaim territory a DW report by Joel Dullroy exclaims the tremendous damage the Ukrainian forces upheld against the Russian army.</p>
                                <p>The Ukrainian government depicts an image of a barrage of rockets hailing down on the Russian base causes masses of destruction and a mass termination of the Russians ammunition. Many professionals and unprofessionals may believe this is a tactical strike in order to lessen the fire on fellow Ukrainians however is this the case? The constant rain and hail on Ukrainian fellows forces them into such an rage where in which they had to break out and defy their oppression. Backing uo this point is a presentation given by president Zielensky showing Ukraine’s anger.Can Ukraine successfully strike back, or will there be a backlash? Only time and the truth will tell.</p>
