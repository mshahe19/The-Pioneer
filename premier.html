                                <p>Manchester City-Unparalleled depth in all positions as they push for the elusive UCL. 

Liverpool-Their attacking firepower will take teams apart but they might not match City’s organisation. 

Spurs-Although there are still weaknesses, under Conte, Spurs are only going to go up in the table. 

Arsenal-Their promising youth is likely to play a key role in any success. 

Chelsea-Despite being a major force as of late, their aging squad may struggle. 

Manchester United-Erik Ten Haag is planning a project and I believe this may take a few years to fully come into play 

West Ham-Under Moyes, West Ham have transformed into a European force but I do not see them claiming an UEL spot. 

Brighton-Brighton notoriously play a high standard of football, if they can sign a top striker, I see them chasing Europe. 

Newcastle-Newcastle’s wealth is certainly something to fear, with recent signings such as Dan Burn and Bruno Guimarães prospering on the Toon. 

 Leicester-Leicester have an exciting squad filled with quality but it seems the club has only been headed downhill since 19/20. 

 Wolves-Again like Leicester, Wolves have a young talented squad with players like Pedro Neto displaying their class on the pitch, their inconsistencies however, are a major flaw in the side. 

  Crystal Palace-Palace have great attacking players but can often fall short in the defensive parts of the pitch 

  Aston Villa-Villa have already made some great signings such as          Boubacar Kamara, however this is not the first time this has happened and I personally feel they will return to mid-table once again. 

  Everton-Like Aston Villa, Everton are no strangers to splashing the cash, with a net spend of £275 million since 2017, I see them improving, but not drastically. 

  Leeds-Leeds are a huge club that belong in the Premier League, and I see them staying up if they replace Kalvin Phillips suitably.  

  Southampton-Southampton have a great manager in Ralph Hasenhüttl but their squad lacks excitement, excluding James Ward Prowse, meaning they may fall short against better teams. 

  Nottingham Forest-Forest the fairy-tale story, having gone from 24th to 4th and clasping promotion for the first time in 23 years, I do not think anyone (excluding Derby fans) wants to see them going back down. 

  Brentford-Last season Brentford impressed massively, with players such as Wissa and Toney excelling for The Bees. Despite this I see second season syndrome coming their way. 

  Fulham-Dubbed a yo-yo club, Fulham can never pen down their Premier League spot for more than a year, I do not see this changing. 

  Bournemouth-In such a strong Premier League like this one, somebody always must finish last, and I think that The Cherries, despite their strengths, will finish last by a strong margin. </p>
