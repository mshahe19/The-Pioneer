                                <p> This afternoon, the north will see sunny spells and a few scattered showers. Mostly sunny and warm for southern areas, but cloudier in the far south. Staying very warm in the far south-east. 

Tonight 

Tonight, southern areas will be dry and mainly clear with just some patchy cloud. A mix of variable cloud, clear spells and isolated showers in the north. A cooler night than of late in the south. </p>
                                <p>Thursday 14th July 

Tomorrow, patchy cloud and scattered showers in northern areas will spread southwards through the morning. However, it will remain largely dry, sunny and warm for much of southern Britain. 

Friday to Sunday 

High pressure is likely to remain largely in control through Friday and into the weekend. A few weak fronts will topple into the north-west at times, bringing spells of rain to Scotland, N Ireland and northern England as well. On Saturday and Sunday, very warm air is likely to be drawn from the south as the high drifts eastwards. It could turn quite hot for England and Wales. </p>
