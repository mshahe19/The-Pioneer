                                <p>After 36 years away, Tom Cruise is back for another blockbuster film which was to become the most successful of his career. This high-flying success is a result of many years preparation, battling it out against the struggles of the last few years.
Tom Cruise kicks off the show by achieving mach 10 in a fighter plane, and then receiving an offer back to 'Top Gun'. However, Maverick receives the surprise of his life, realising that he has been sent back to teach a new generation of hopefuls, and for him it is love at first flight as he meets Jennifer Connely; the new bartender.</p>
                                <p>Goose's son Rooster(played by Miles Teller) brings rising tensions within the new Top Gun crew, as on his mother's request, Maverick is forced to delay his piloting career and Rooster is struggling to forgive him. Maverick will not explane what his mother had decided, and so tensions and sky high.
Rooster however, is a mirror image of his father, playing piano and singing the age-old lines, 'Great Balls of Fire'. Lady Gaga has also enterd the new soundtrack with hit song, 'Hold my Hand'. And Tom Whitlock makes a return as 'Take my Breath Away' reenters the soundtrack. A new entry is a song by One Republic, called 'I ain't worried bout it', that plays during an american football game reflecting almost perfectly the volleyball scene in the first film.</p>
