                                <h3 class="mb-3">THE RESIGNATION OF THE PM </h3>
                                <p>After nearly 3 years, the PM, Boris Johnson, has finally resigned after the government made him resign on the grounds that he was ‘abusing power’. Unexpectedly, the vote of no confidence to confirm this is expected on Wednesday without any parliamentary time.  

 

A Labour spokesman said “Yet again the Tories are changing the rules to protect their own dodgy mates. All the Tory leadership candidates should denounce flagrant abuse of power to protect their own prime minister”, in response to this. </p>
                                <p>However, on Monday, the newly established 1922 Committee confirmed that he would be staying in office until the 5th November. Naturally, the government is arguing that the vote is a waste of time as Boris has ‘already resigned’. Keir Starmer also said that it would be ‘intolerable to Britain’ if they let him ‘cling on until the 5th'. Since his resignation was announced, Boris has been appointing several unusual successors to the position and is intending hand out resignation knighthoods and peerages to allies, examples being culture secretary Nathan Dorries, and, supposedly, his own father. </p>

                                <p>To further expand upon this, Boris’s wife, Carrie Johnson said that 10 Downing Street felt ‘like a prison’. His sister, Rachel Johnson, also said farewell to her brother being PM, saying that Boris ‘wanted to become world king at two, and actually almost achieved that’ during her speech. </p>
