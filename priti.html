                                <p>BRITISH home secretary Priti Patel has ruled herself out of the Tory leadership race to replace Boris Johnson after spending days mulling over whether to stand.

Ms Patel said she would not be standing just hours before the deadline for the first hurdle of securing nominations from 20 Conservative MPs.

Eight contenders will be on the ballot paper when Tory MPs begin voting today to elect a successor to Johnson, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, announced.</p>
                                <p>Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat, Kemi Badenoch, Penny Mordaunt, Jeremy Hunt, Nadhim Zahawi and Suella Braverman all secured the 20 nominations from fellow MPs needed to enter the contest.

Patel made her announcement after cabinet allies Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries gave their backing to foreign secretary Liz Truss as the Brexiteers’ candidate.

In a statement, Ms Patel said: “I am grateful for the encouragement and support colleagues and party members have offered me in recent days in suggesting that I enter the contest for the leadership of the Conservative Party.

“I will not be putting my name forward for the ballot of MPs.

“I will be listening to cases being put forward by the candidates standing for the leadership of the party, and trust the contest will be conducted in a good spirit that brings our party together.</p>

                                <p>Sources close to Ms Patel would not disclose the reasons behind her decision, nor would they indicate who she is likely to back as the next prime minister.

She has been dogged by bullying allegations in the past, claims she denies, and there have been warnings against crowding out right-wing candidates.
