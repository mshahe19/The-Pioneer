                                <h3 class="mb-3">Monkeypox cases skyrocket </h3>
                                <p>Monkeypox is a DNA virus. 18 new cases of monkeypox have been found in England by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), and one additional case has been found in Scotland. As of June 7th, 321 people have been confirmed in the UK as of this point. 305 confirmed cases have been reported so far, with 11 cases in Scotland, 2 cases in Northern Ireland, and 3 cases in Wales. Most cases that have been reported to date have involved males who have intercourse with other men, so even while this advice is applicable to everyone, we are urging these individuals to be aware of the signs, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. If you develop a blistered rash, you should call NHS 111 or a sexual health centre right away if you: had spent the last three weeks in close proximity to someone who has or may have monkeypox (even if they have not been tested), had recently returned from a trip to West or Central Africa, a man who engages in male sex.  </p>
                                <p>Dr Ruth Milton, Senior Medical Advisor at UKHSA said:                                                                                                

 “Monkeypox is a DNA virus. Most cases that have been reported to date have involved gay, bisexual, and males who have intercourse with other men, so even while this advice applies to everyone, we are urging these individuals to be aware of the signs, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. If you develop a blistered rash, you should call NHS 111 or a sexual health centre right away if you: had spent the last three weeks near someone who has or may have monkeypox (even if they have not been tested), had recently returned from a trip to West or Central Africa, a man who engages in male sex.” 

Health protection teams from the UKHSA are contacting individuals who are thought to be high-risk contacts of cases that have been confirmed and are encouraging those who have undergone risk assessments and are in good health to isolate at home for up to 21 days. To lower the likelihood of symptomatic infection and severe disease, UKHSA has additionally ordered more than 20,000 doses of the safe smallpox vaccine Imvanex (provided by Bavarian Nordic). This is being distributed to found close contacts of persons who have been diagnosed with monkeypox. </p>
